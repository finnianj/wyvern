Current status:

Working on admin functions: writing new blog posts, displaying all applications in dashboard, editing about page etc.

Latest update:

Application form configured. Candidate model/controller created as well as new/create paths. 
You can now create a new application and it will validate only if your email is unique and if certain parameters are filled.

Green Navbar for admin, because the admin is special.

You can now create new blog posts and see all your blogposts displayed in a blog page.
